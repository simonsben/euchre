# Euchre game

Currently at the beginning of what (I hope) will turn into another big project for me...

## Game (now)

This stage of the project is simply making the mechanics for a euchure game.
Nothing complicated, just want to be able to shuffle cards, deal, and have command-line games.
Should also enforce rules  (i.e. don't allow cheating).

## Computer player

This is the point of the project, I want to look into making an intelligent computer opponent.
Specifically (and the reason this is in python) is so I can easily use TensorFlow (when I finally get there..).

## Make it playable (nicely)?

If things work well, then maybe I'll put some time to make a graphical wrapper around the game..
Probably a good excuse to keep my React up to date
